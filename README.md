#**min**imal responsive front-end **frame**work

minframe is a modern HTML5, mobile-first framework built with Sass and Gulp on a 12 column responsive grid. The framework boasts all of the modern accessiblility features and tools developers use in builds but none of the style bloat. The only boilerplate styling is normalize.scss, our 12 column responsive grid and basic HTML5 Sass nesting. Javascript is only required during the build process, not in the browser. 

##Automated Development Tools

-Responsive grid built on Sass preprocessor is automatically compiled, concatenated, minified and auto-prefixed along with your custom styles to support legacy browsers.

-Server side PHP5 form validation, sanitation and email processing.
